> Collection of scratch pads for many of my current projects

I move between computers and operating systems quite often. Just about everything I do (on a computer - scripts, compile code, notes, posts, comments, etc.) starts onm a scratch pad of some type where I can work out some of the kinks before trying to apply them to their inetended purposes. This repos is intended to help make them more portable as I move between computers and operating systems and provide some historical context.
